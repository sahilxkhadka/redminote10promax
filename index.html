        <p class="home-text">Here's a review of the much hyped Redmi Note 10 pro Max which was launched few months ago by Xiaomi. I've been using this device as my daily driver for roughly four months now and  I'll be talking about it's key features, pros and cons along with my final thoughts.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="design-build" class="container">
        <h1 class="design-heading">1.Design & Build</h1>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./img/design.jpg" alt="design">
        </div>
        <div class="design-text">
            <p>Coming from last year's note lineup, this year we can see significant changes on the design of the phone. The rare
                camera placement has been shifted towards the side, the punch hole on the front is also significantly smaller. The company
               has been generous enough to give glass back with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection on both front and back but the sides are made up of
                plastic. The color options this year look more refurbished and are appealing to the eyes. The one that I have is of 'Dark Knight' color.
               This is the only one with glossy back and fingerprint marks are significantly noticeable, I'd highly recommend you using the
               case that comes within the box. I've beem using this phone without a case and the Gorills Glass on the back seems to be
               promising as there are no scratches on it yet. The other color options that the company has to offer have matt finish, so 
               fingerprint marks are not much of a concern in those variants. Also, this phone has a headphone jack which is on a 
               disappearing trend and is a must have for gaming centric people. This year Redmi has worked on the design and build 
               quality which definitely makes this phone look and feel better than other phones on the market in the similar price range.
               Despite having a Super Amoled display the phone features a side mounted fingerprint sensor which feels really snappy.
               The volume control buttons are just above the fingerprint sensor which are easily reachable if you have big hands and are 
               clicky as well. </p>

    <div id="display" class="container">
        <h1 class="display-heading">2.Display</h1>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="./img/display.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="display-text">
            <p>The display is where the manufacturers have really listened to the voice of the customers. The phone packs a 120Hz Super
                amoled panel replacing the 60Hz IPS LCD Display from last year. It is a 6.67 inches screen with the aspect ratio of 21:9.
                Viewing contents on this phone feels immersive and the colors are well balanced with deeper blacks. It's display is bright 
                enough for outdoor usage making it visible even during sunlight. The Sunlight mode also helps boost the brighntess 
                when outdoors. The brightness of it's screen can go all the way upto 1200 nits(while viewing HDR content). The display is
                well strectched upto the edges and has very thin bezels and the chin at the bottom is also very thin. The approach of placing
                the selfie camera at the center which provides symmetry seems to be a good one as the display looks fantastic. Whereas, 
                120Hz is where the problem arrives. The screen flickers a number of times when set on 120Hz which might be disturbing
                for few. The most talked about feature about the phone was its 120Hz display but that does not deliver as it supposed to. 
                There was a software update claiming to improve the high refresh rate issue, but in my unit I did not notice any bigger 
                changes after the update that could have fixed my problem. Sticking to 60Hz which of course saves a lot of battery , the
                phone has one of the best displays in the market.</p>

        <div class="camera-text">
            <p>Also named as the 108MP Voyager, the Redmi Note 10 pro max has a quad camera setup. It consists of a 108MP(f/1.9)
                main camera, 8MP(f/2.4) ultrawide lens, 5MP(f/2.4) macro lens and a 2MP(f/2.4) depth sensor. The 108MP camera
                clicks image with fair amount of detail but the images could look even more great if the image processing had been more
                to the point like that of Samsung which definitely provides better photos through it's software. Xiaomi really needs to bring 
                a software update mainly focusing on this. The same applies for the rest of the camera units as well.Talking about
                potrait shots the background blur is decent and there are many filters too which make the shots look better. The camera app of 
                Xiaomi's phone is always a fun tool to play with as it packs many exciting features such as long exposure, vlog mode, clone 
                and many others to play around with. Night mode is there but as mentioned before it could have been better, we can notice
                that the quality drops and noise increases while capturing photos during night. While recording videos the max we can go is
                4k@30fps and it can also capture slowmo videos upto 720p@960fps. There is no OIS(Optical Image Stabalization) here but
                the videos look quite stable. Up on the front we have a 16MP(f/2.5) selfie camera which is somewhat okay for taking selfies.
                We can record upto 1080p@30fps from the front. With the features in it, this phone can also be a good option for vlogging and social media contents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="performance-text">
            <p>With its Snapdragon 732G processor, the phone seems to handle day to day tasks seamlessly. Apps open quick and the animations also
                feel smooth without any lag. Coming from last year's 720G they could have gone for a better processor either from mediatek or any higher
                of the snapdragon family. The processor is decent performance wise while gaming or any other heavy tasks. Games like COD mobile and
                PUBG can be played at fairly high graphics and frame rates, whereas extreme(60fps) on the PUBG mobile would have been highly appreciated. They could also have picked a flagship processor from last year like snapdragon860 or any other. With the UFS 2.2 storage which is claimed to be 100% faster then UFS 2.1 makes the phone feel faster too. The phone heats up to a decent amount around the cameras while gaming which is normal otherwise the processor handles it pretty well and the battery drain is also not high. Few apps still need to be optimised, despite having  a good processor we can notice that the phone does not perform well with the apps like microsoft teams, lightroom mobile(the camera does not work at all) and the chat bubbles in the messenger app too which can be easily fixed if the authorities pay proper attention towards it. If you are a normal user then there is no way that the phone will upset you with its performance . But if you are into gaming and perform other heavy tasks on your phone then there are plenty of other options available for you in the market. Throttling issue is also noticeable overtime and keeping it on 120HZ the phone starts to feel warm after some time even while performing simple tasks. The mic issue on MI phones seems to everlasting as on this phone too the person on the other side does not hear my voice clear sometimes. At last, had the company used this processor to its full potential the phone could definitely perform better. Xiaomi provides one of the best hardwares but their software spoils the performance of the phone to some extent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="battery-text">
            <p>The phone is powered by a 5020mah battery which lasts for around 1.5 days if you are a normal user. I still have around 40% battery left during bedtime after a full day of usage. The battery capacity is not increased from last year but the charging speed has been upgraded from 27W to 33W this year. And yes the charger is included in the box. The company claims that the phone can charge from 0-100% in just 55 minutes but I found that it takes around 1hr 10 minutes to get fully charged which is still good. The phone gets warm sometimes so I recommend you not to use the phone while charging. The battery drain in the phone while kept idle is also slightly high compared to phones from other companies such as Samsung,Realme etc.</p>

        <div class="miui-text">
            <p>Currently, the phone is running on MIUI 12.5.4 which fixed issues like slow opening of notification shade while swiping down and many more. The phone feels smoother than before after the update. It comes with a security update of May. The bond between MIUI and bugs seems to be never ending. We can notice them here and there throughout the system. Although MIUI provides a huge level of customization options as compared to others. There are many themes, fonts and icon packs available for free which can enhance the look and feel of your phone whereas other companies like samsung ask you to pay for these features. But customization is not all that a user wants, they want the UI of their phone to be smooth, free of bugs and optimised as well. It is rumored that Xiaomi has hired a special team for their next MIUI 13 so lets wait and see the results.</p>

            <p>On paper this phone looks as the best phone in it's price range. If you are expecting the phone to perform as good as it looks on paper then I think you should take a break and jump into phones from other companies. But if you are a general user with just simple tasks to do on your phone then you can definitely watch out for this phone. A big display, long lasting battery, good  processor and high specsheet of cameras this phone has it all. </p>
